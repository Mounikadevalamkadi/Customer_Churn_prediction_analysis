# Customer_Churn_prediction_analysis
Introduction:
•	The goal of this project is to analyze and predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. 
•	By understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn, the company can develop strategies to retain customers and improve their satisfaction. 
•	The dataset includes various attributes such as customer demographics, account information, and usage metrics.

Insights Gained from the Project:
1.	Customer Demographics:
•	Geography: The majority of customers are from France, followed by Spain and Germany, indicating key market areas.
•	Gender: Female customers outnumber male customers, suggesting potential targeting strategies for female-centric products.
•	Age: Most customers are in the 30-40 age range, highlighting a middle-aged customer base.
2.	Credit Score Analysis:
•	Geography: French customers generally have higher median credit scores, while Spanish customers show variability with some lower scores.
•	Distribution: The overall distribution of credit scores is slightly right-skewed, with most customers having scores between 650-700.
3.	Balance and Estimated Salary Analysis:
•	Balance: A significant portion of customers have a zero balance, while another peak suggests a group maintaining moderate balances.
•	Salary: Salaries are evenly distributed, indicating a diverse customer base across income levels.
     4. Churn Analysis:
•	Churn Rate: Approximately 20% of customers have churned. France shows a moderate churn rate, Spain the highest, and Germany the lowest.
•	Tenure: Customers with shorter tenures (1-2 years) are more likely to churn, while those with 3-7 years show higher retention.
     5.  Product and Services Analysis:
•	Number of Products: Most customers hold only one product, with a significant drop for those holding two or more.
•	Balance by Products: Customers with more products tend to have higher balances, indicating deeper engagement.
•	Credit Card Ownership: Those with credit cards generally maintain higher balances.
•	Card Type: DIAMOND cardholders have the highest median balances, followed by PLATINUM, GOLD, and SILVER.

Conclusion:
This project provides comprehensive insights into customer demographics, financial behaviour, and churn 
dynamics, shedding light on significant patterns and trends that can inform strategic decisions.

Strategic Recommendations:
1.	Targeted Retention Programs:
•	Focus on new customers (1-2 years tenure) to reduce churn.
•	Implement loyalty programs for customers beyond 3 years to maintain their engagement.
2.	Geographical Expansion:
•	Strengthen marketing efforts in France and Spain, leveraging insights on credit score and churn dynamics.
•	Explore growth opportunities in Germany given the low churn rates.
3.	Product Bundling:
•	Develop bundled product offerings to encourage customers to hold more than one product, leveraging the insights on balance and product holding patterns.
4.	Financial Products:
•	Design financial products and credit card offerings targeted at high-balance customers, especially those in the DIAMOND and PLATINUM segments.
